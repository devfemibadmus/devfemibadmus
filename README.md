# Full-Stack Developer Overview

A dynamic and results-driven full-stack developer, I specialize in web development using Django, with a particular focus on building robust APIs using Django Rest Framework. My journey in the programming landscape commenced with expertise in frontend technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Evolving into a full-stack role, I mastered the intricacies of managing database models and seamlessly transitioned between frontend and backend development.

## Additional Expertise

In addition to web development, my skill set extends to Python frameworks such as Flask, where I have garnered extensive experience in deploying machine learning (ML) projects and crafting small-scale web applications. My proficiency in Flask has enabled me to tackle diverse projects, showcasing adaptability and versatility in my technical capabilities.

## Linux Proficiency

My Linux proficiency is rooted in the Linux OS, where I have honed the skills necessary to handle Virtual Private Servers (VPS) from inception, encompassing the installation and configuration of essential components. This expertise underscores my ability to navigate the intricacies of infrastructure, ensuring seamless deployment and maintenance.

## Cloud Experience

Furthermore, my journey in the cloud extends to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where, over the past three years, I have successfully undertaken and delivered distinct projects. Leveraging GCP services such as Storage, App Engine, Compute Engine, and SQL, I've demonstrated a capacity for creating scalable and efficient solutions.

Beyond GCP, my expertise encompasses Microsoft Azure, where I not only excel in creating applications but also implement robust security measures. My focus on data integrity and confidentiality aligns with contemporary best practices, ensuring the safeguarding of sensitive information.
